This mcdonald's  is located in Raffles place after you exit from City Mall Mrt. Service is good. Taking the order separately & wait ur number for the foods by checking the Screen. Never get disappointed visiting any branch of McDonald's.

Nice place
Good location. Good and fast service of the staff. The taste of the food was also good. Big place so crowd is divided.

Quiet place on a Sunday afternoon
The Boat Quay outlet is quiet and nice on Sundays, as the business district winds down over the weekend. Kids love to run around UOB plaza as well.

OMG BEST BURGER EVER! 
Why the fricken do we not have this burgers in Europe or the states! 

My mouth gets watery only when I‚Äôm thinking about this 2 beautiful food objects! 

The first of why do we not have the same quality of chicken?!? And why can they...( Singapore) have grilled chicken meanwhile we only have fried chicken! Not fair! 

The first is a grilled chicken salad with amazing taste and amazing dressing!  Everything went super! 

And the other is the chicken burger! Omg! 
It has red coleslaw, pineapple, grilled chicken, cheese, lettuce and an amazing sauce! 
I need This in my life every day! 

If your in Singapore and haven‚Äôt try this one then do because you won‚Äôt regret it at all! 

Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.
