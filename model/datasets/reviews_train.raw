always full
Never can find a space to sit here. The tables are always full and when people finish eating, they don't clean up after themselves. 
This is one of the worst Mcdonalds.

No Service branch at North point and Causeway pt Singapore
I dont know about other branches but so far the this two branches the Service has been very bad. The Mccafe and icecream section the staff are very rude and never greet customer sometimes when i make an order for an icecream they will say...No stock but it show there is and i seen people im queue ordering.Also sometimes i ask for something they do not understand amd argue with me like the Auntie staff in icecream section and the  student staff selling icecream  in causeway point Macdonald too is very rude .They misunderstand my order and even Correct it in their own words what are they trying to prove they are very smart .seriously lacking service .Even after showing off what she label the name of icecream and i told her other collegue of the name she told me and still her other blur collegue do not understand what i was talking about really lacking experience and empathy .This is frustrating and bad service

Recycled cooking oil in the mcmuffin?

One,  it tastes like recycled cooking oil and two, it is unnecessary and unhealthy. Wouldn't it be better to serve the muffin as is or let the...More

Trying the new festive burger
After seeing the ads on TV and the newspapers, I ‘succumbed’ to the ads and bought the burger set to try. 

For the festive burger, it had beef patty, lettuce, tomato, sautéed onions and an ‘artificial’ turkey bacon. 

The burger was not bad, except for...More

Perfect location on the river
McDonald's is pretty much McDonald's the world over (with a few culturally-specific changes to some menu items). But this McDonald's is ideally located on the river, which makes for a great setting to what is probably not going to be your most exciting meal/snack. After...More

Local & High Tech Too
This visit to Singapore I discovered a new taste and way to order.  You can order automatically through a screen to skip the usual line to order in person,  All orders show up on a screen and are picked up from the same counter.  Despite...my reluctance to place an automatic order, I did keep coming back for the Lychee McFizz that is refreshing.

First time trying something new
First time trying their prosperity burger, it was fabulous. Tried their highly raved mcspicy too, it was a little too spicy for my liking but it was flavourful and juicy. Hope it can be sold worldwide.

Why would you?
You're in one of the great food cities of the world and you want.....this? 

Look a little further, if it's the value for money you want there's so much better quality at the same price at any hawker centre or food court.

Good staff at the entry of McDonalds Parkway Parade Branch
Staff at the entry point of McDonald's Parkway Parade Branch was a very humble and friendly lady. She greets everybody when they scanned safe entry QR code and had the temperature checked. She even wished the customer goodbye and thankyou when they leave the restaurant....She is always there with a smile. Good job McDonald for having  such a friendly and sweet  staff. Keep up the good job.

You pay for what you get, food is average however new burger is good
McDonalds is a place where most of us go for a quick snack, the fries as of late have been inconsistent and at times to served lukewarm. Better start getting that right again.  Chicken burger tasted like card board, however the new beef burger with...mushrooms tastes actually like beef and it says it is 100% Angus. It reminded me of the days when Big Mac was introduced and still tasted good.  The angle of food has to become a more real-food angle. Todays consumers are more health conscious. Tell them too what is really in the burgers and win their trust as too many negatives are spread over the internet. Also work on the healthy offerings as we all are more careful what we put in our bodies. The new Angus Burger I would rate 5 out of 5 and will go back for it. Yes it is a bit more expensive but worth it.  I do want to recognize the fact that the ordering system is very good and minimizes waiting time.   Well done, keep on working on your product quality please. There are many who will pay more for that.

Couldn’t get the order correct

Manager...just hides away when there’s a complaint as well

New Combination
Try the McGriddle Meal of Mcdonalds for breakfast. It is very delicious as the bun used is pancake instead of the usual McMuffin Meal. Also, coffee is refillable so drink all you can.

Strange experience
I ordered a regular hamburger with catsup, onions, and pickles but, no mustard there. But, the person who waited on me did not understand me so, I had to point it out with a pic on the menu. They serve corn with melted butter. I...never saw it before at a McDonald's in the USA.
